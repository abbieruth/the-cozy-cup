# How It's Made:
Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, Visual Studio Code

All photos and videos are licensed; they are not my own.

# Lessons Learned:
Flexbox.  I am still learning flexbox. I will probably always be learning flexbox.  It is easier than floats but it still sometimes has me pulling at my hair and begging
my code to just work.

**Warning: There is a bug with the About Us section on smaller screens. I am aware of it and I am trying to fix it. Please be patient, though, as I have a lot of other 
things going right now.
